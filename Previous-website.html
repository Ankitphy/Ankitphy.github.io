        <p>I'm stuck in my home due to
            the Coronavirus Pandemic, and have been in my home away from my college, where I should have been now. <br>
            It all started silently in December 2019, when the first case of COVID ie. Coronavirus disease was found in the Wuhan city of China. First it caused havoc
            in China and after that quickly started spreading in all over the world. Soon it reached India, when near the end of the month of January, the first case 
            of this COVID-19 was reported in the national capital of India, ie. New Delhi. At first, this resulted into experts getting little cautious about it, but 
            soon after it started causing distress in the general public also. After the mid-sem exams at my university in early march, the vacations for the colorful 
            festivel of Holi was announced. We happily moved to our homes for celebrating the occasion, having not even a pinhead amount of idea that such a large
            disaster was ahead of us waiting, and this would have such a large impact in our lives and career. Around mid-march the COVID cases in the city of Varansi,
            started to rise so rapidly that the local government has to announce Complete lockdown. So it became clear that we won't be able to go to college soon, but 
            didn't have any idea that it would last for around 2 full years. Soon after that the Prime minister of India annouced the complete lockdown at first on 21st
            march first for 1 day and later for 21 days, but this lockdown did't end after 21 days but again another locdown for more time was announced, which 
            continued to extend till june. It should be noted that it was a complete lockdown. No economic activities was allowed. No buses, no trains, no shops, 
            no personal vehicles like car and bikes were allowed to run on the road. Only the activies which were absolutely vital were allowed. On one hand people
            were dying, while on the other hand the people which went on the streets were beaten up. It was a very unproductive and grim situation for the nation 
            After that seeing a slight declined in the cases, government started to slwoly lift the lockdown restriction, to open the economy because economy was
            badly affected and data came that the rate of GDP growth has declined to around -24% in maybe 2nd or 3rd sememster, which I do not remember clearly.
            And this trend continued till february, after which a second wave of surge in the COVID cases started, which I'll discuss in the next blog post.
        </p>

        <p>
            So now let's talk of what happened in the months after February when the COVID cases started to resurge. <br>
            So when the cases of COVID of was continue declining for 4-5 months, people had a hope that everything was normal and also several vaccines have been
            devised so there's no need to worry. While this excitement was not something that needs to be alleged because, the studies of the students were affected, 
            various exams were on hold, many people who are wage labourers, who had to earn daily for eating a meal at night, were compelled to sleep many nights 
            without foods in their stomach for many months. So overall according to people it was the time to rejoice their victory over the Pandemic. But experts 
            were observing the whole world and by analysing the cases of previous pandemics, came to the conclusion that second wave of this Pandemic was sure to
            come, which has already come in European countries in the months of January and February. So experts warned the Government to not take this situation
            carefully and also the general public. Accordingly, the government did the deed of advising the people to not go out of home without any necessary work
            and also follow all the standard safety measures laid out by the experts. But, despite this all 'Suggested Precaution by the government',  they were 
            first to break to the rules as the Prime minster himself went for campaigning in west bengal and gathered the large crawd for his address on behalf of
            his ruling party BJP. Also the religeous gathering of Kumbh was allowed. All of this lead to the massive rate of surge exponentially over the month of 
            march. And starting from the end of march, India saw the worst case scenario of the pandemics which is not explainable through words and which any part
            of the world had not experienced, fuel added in the fire by the poor medical infrastructure of the country. Beds on the hospitals were full. At its worst 
            part, Indian reported around 400, 000 cases per day, reported officially and a devastating recovering percentage of around 80 %, also reported officially.
            The families, which didn't hear the cases of COVID in the previous wave, were hearing the demise of close relatives by this COVID. In the earlier wave, 
            the maximum no. of cases recorded per day at its peak was 1/4th of this wave and recovery rated were also good. But the level of disaster this second 
            wave brought to the people is scary and unexplainable through words. Now the situation is under control, after the help from many part of the world. 
            So let's see, in what way afterwards, the life unfolds itself before us.
