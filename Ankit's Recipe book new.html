<!--Steps to perform-->
        <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> First rinse, peel and then grate the carrots (8-9 medium sized tender juicy carrots), either with a hand held grater or in a food processor. You need approx 4 to 4.5 cups grated carrots.<br><br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> In a kadai or deep thick bottomed pan combine milk and grated carrots. On a low to medium flame, bring the whole mixture to a boil and then simmer. While the mixture is simmering on a low flame, keep on stirring in between. The grated carrots will cook in the milk and the milk will start to reduce and evaporate.<br><br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> When the milk has 75% reduced, add the ghee, sugar and powdered cardamom to the mixture. Stir well and continue to simmer and cook on a low flame. Do keep on stirring the halwa in between.<br><br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Towards the end, add the cashews, almonds, saffron and raisins. Simmer the halwa till all the milk is evaporated. Switch off the burner. Serve gajar halwa hot, warm or you can also serve it cold. garnish with some chopped dry fruits while serving.<br><br>
        </p>

    <!--Steps to perform-->
    
<p>
         <strong>Step 1:</strong> The potatoes and green peas have to be cooked together first.<br><br>
    
        <strong>Cooking In Stovetop Pressure Cooker:</strong> In a 3 or 4 litre pressure cooker take 4 to 5 large potatoes and 2.5 cups water. Place a small trivet and keep a bowl containing ½ cup green peas in it. Pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles on medium to medium-high flame.
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>Making Green Peas Stuffing:</strong> 
            <ul><li> Drain the water from the steamed green peas using a small strainer or colander. Take the peas in a bowl and mash them.</li>
                <li>Mash to a coarse texture.</li>
                <li>To the peas, add red chilli powder or cayenne pepper, coriander powder, fennel powder, dry mango powder, finely chopped ginger, green chillies, coriander leaves, black salt and regular salt as per taste.</li>
                <li>Mix very well. Check taste and add more salt or spice powders if required.</li>
            </ul>
        <br><br>
</p>
        
<p>
        <strong>Making Potato Mixture:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meanwhile drain the water from the potatoes as well and let them become warm.</li>
                    <li>When the potatoes are warm, then peel them and grate. I find it easier to grate the potatoes and then mash them. However, you can also chop them and mash with a potato masher. Let the grated or mashed potatoes cool completely.</li>
                    <li>After the mashed potatoes have cooled completely, add the following ingredients: red chilli powder or cayenne pepper, garam masala powder or curry powder, coriander powder, dry mango powder, black salt and regular salt as per taste.</li>
                    <li>Next add bread crumbs and arrowroot flour. Instead of arrowroot flour, you can also add rice flour, corn flour (corn starch) or tapioca starch or roasted besan (roasted chickpea flour or roasted gram flour).</li>
                    <li>Mix everything very well.</li>
                </ul>
        <br><br>
</p>
        

<p>
        <strong>Stuffing And Shaping Aloo Tikki:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide the mixture into small or medium shaped patties with a hollow center or cup shaped discs. You can apply some oil on your palms when making the patties or tikki.</li>
                    <li>Place the green peas filling in the center.</li>
                    <li>Bring the mashed potato edges on the top and seal them.</li>
                    <li>Roll gently between your palms and gently flatten. Make all aloo tikki this way.</li>
                </ul>
</p>


<p>
                <strong>Frying Aloo Tikki
:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil till on a skillet or tawa or frying pan till it is medium hot. Gently place the tikki and begin to pan-fry them.</li>
                    <li>When the base is crispy and golden, gently flip each tikki with a spatula.</li>
                    <li>Fry the second side till crispy and golden. You can gently flip once or twice more till the aloo tikki are golden and crisp evenly.</li>
                    <li>Remove and place in a strainer kept on top of a bowl. You can even drain them on paper towels. Fry all tikkis this way. Add 2 tablespoons more oil when frying the second batch.</li>
                    <li>Serve Aloo Tikki plain with coriander chutney & tamarind chutney. You can also serve these potato patties with sweet yogurt raita.</li>
                </ul>
                
        <br><br>
</p>
        
    <!--Notes-->

<p>
        <strong>Notes:</strong>
                <ul class="Notes">
                    <li><strong>If making aloo tikki for fasting:</strong> Add arrowroot flour or buckwheat flour or water chestnut flour or sago flour. Use rock salt, instead of regular salt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Servings:</strong> Recipe makes 6 large tikki. You can make then medium sized or large. </li>
                    <li><strong>Spices & Herbs:</strong> You can reduce or increase the spice powder and herbs. A variation is to add fresh mint leaves to the tikki. You can even add chaat masala powder.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crispiness:</strong> You can twice fry the tikki. First fry till pale golden. Then again fry till crispy and golden. </li>
                    <li><strong>Stuffing:</strong> The spiced green peas stuffing can be given a skip. You can even substitute green peas with steamed sweet corn, grated paneer (cottage cheese) and cooked chana dal (split chickpeas). </li>
                    <li><strong>Binding Ingredients:</strong> Add the binding ingredients which you have in your pantry. So in place of arrowroot flour you can add corn starch, rice flour, roasted besan (roasted chickpea flour), tapioca starch, potato starch or soaked bread slices. But do not skip on breadcrumbs as they aid in getting a nice crispy crust on the tikki. </li>
                </ul>

    <strong>Procedure:</strong> <br>
    
        <strong>Making malpua batter</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl take 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp fennel seeds, 3 to 4 cardamoms, crushed or 1/3 tsp cardamom powder. Mix the dry ingredients well.</li>
            <li>Add 3 tbsp khoya and 3 tbsp curd/yogurt. Please use fresh yogurt. Instead of khoya you can also use milk powder.</li>
            <li>Add 1/2 cup water and begin to stir to a thick flowing batter without lumps.</li>
            <li>Allow the batter to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile when the batter is resting blanch the almonds and pistachios in hot water. Keep them soaked in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes. Then peel and slice them. Keep aside.</li>
        </ol>
</p>
        
<p>
        <strong>Making sugar syrup</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Also heat 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water. On a low flame simmer this mixture. Also stir well so that the sugar melts.</li>
            <li>You need to have a 1/2 inch string or 1 string consistency in the sugar syrup. If you cannot achieve these string consistencies than just make a sticky syrup. The sugar needs to be kept warm. For this keep the sugar syrup on a hot water bath so that it stays warm throughout and does not crystallize. Meaning keep the sugar syrup pan on a bowl or another pan filled with hot water. The hot water should touch the base of the pan containing the sugar syrup.</li>
        </ol>
</p>


<p>
        <strong>Making Malpua</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat ghee in a pan or griddle.</li>
            <li>When the ghee is heating up add 3 pinches soda or 1/8 tsp baking soda to the malpua batter.</li>
            <li>Mix very well.</li>
            <li>Lower the flame. Take 2 tbsp to 3 tbsp of the batter and gently pour it on the hot ghee. Spread the batter lightly with the back of the spoon. Make 2 to 4 malpua depending on the size of the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry on a low to medium till crisp and golden flipping the malpua a couple of times.</li>
            <li>Drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        </ol>
</p>

<p>
        <strong>Adding Malpua to sugar syrup</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Then immediately place them in the warm sugar syrup. Gently coat the malpua with the sugar syrup with a spoon or small tongs.</li>
            <li>Immediately remove them and place them in a serving tray or plate. Prepare all malpua this way and coat them with the sugar syrup.</li>
            <li>Pour some rabri on top. Garnish with the chopped almonds and pistachios. Serve the malpua with rabdi hot. You can also just serve them coated with the sugar syrup and garnished with the dry fruits.</li>
        </ol>
</p>

<p>
        <strong>Making Rabri to serve with Malpua</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>In a broad thick bottomed pan or sauce pan or a kadai take 1.25 litres of full fat whole milk and bring it first to boil.
</li>
            <li>Lower the flame and continue to simmer the milk. Stir at intervals.
</li>
            <li>Bring the clotted cream/malai which forms on top of the milk to the sides of the pan. Also keep on scraping the dried milk from the sides and add them back to the milk.
</li>
            <li>Do stir and scrape often so that the milk does not get browned or burnt from the bottom as well as the sides.
</li>
            <li>Keep on simmering, stirring, removing the clotted cream and scraping.
</li>
            <li>Switch off when the milk has reduced and become thickened.
</li>
            <li>Add sugar. Stir well so that the sugar dissolves.
</li>
            <li>Next add crushed saffron or saffron powder along with kewra water (pandanus water) or rose water. Add the sliced almonds and pistachios.
</li>
            <li>It will take about 1 hour for the milk to thicken on a low flame.
</li>
            <li>Remove the rabri in a bowl and serve it later with the malpua. Refrigerate if not using it immediately. The combo of malpua rabdi taste good and is liked by many people. Its best and recommended to have malpua rabdi hot.
</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Notes</strong>
            <ul class="Notes">
                <li>For a low fat version, you can also cook the malpua like pancakes by just adding a bit of oil or ghee.
</li>
                <li>Sugar can be added to the batter and you can make sweet malpua. This way you don't need to make sugar syrup or rabdi.
</li>
                <li>Whole wheat flour can be substituted. You need to add some more water if using whole wheat flour. Please seive the whole wheat flour before making the batter.
</li>
                <li>You can also fry them in oil instead of ghee.
</li>
                <li>If you are not in a hurry, then allow the malpua batter to ferment for 6 to 7 hours. If you ferment the batter then you don't need to add baking soda.
</li>
                <li>Fruits like mashed bananas or applesauce or mango pulp can also be added to the batter.
</li>
            </ul>
